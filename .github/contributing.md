# Contributing to ConGL âœ¨

If you are reading this, that means you are interested in contributing to ConGL ðŸ–¥! 
I'm glad that you are reading this, because it would be nice to have one more developer involved into this project. 

## New Ideas ðŸ’¡
If you have a great idea about new feature, implementation, etc. feel free to feature it in **Issues**

## Code Style 
Try to read some of the code for better understanding, then you'll get into it :)
* Comment on to your code
* Make it Clean
* Make it Beatiful
* Make it Simple

## Reporting Issues ðŸ“•
If you found a bug, an error or just a better way to implement something, then report it or pull a request with your changes! 

## Writing Code 
Firstly, please respect code style.
At the moment ConGL is using only [windows.h](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/) API


## Thank you!
Big thanks for reading through all of this. I hope that you'll become our new contributor, and will help ConGL grow ðŸ˜Š
