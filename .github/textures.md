# Textures
Textures are used with sprite objects.
You can set sprite texture either with code arrays, or using .txr files.
[Here](examples/showimage.cpp) is an example of using second.

### Generating .txr
This [formatter](../textures/formatter.exe) converts your [txt texture](../textures/examples/example1.txt) or image to texture, that will be later used by ConGL.

##### formatter itself
Usage - `formatter <file> <out>`
